### Why?
We want to _harness_ the immense potential in linking consumers and influencers, by empowering the latter to reach an audience of the first.

### How?
Influencers create a list of the products (bundles) that are used in their **tutorials** (food recipes, make-up looks, daily outfits... ), These bundles can be shared on **social media** (Instagram, Youtube, Blog, Facebook, Pinterest...) through a simple link.

Followers can view them and quickly add those products to their Continent Basket.

Influencers are rewarded after a certain number of "additions to the basket", as an incentive to produce better content and keep on consuming Continente's products.
